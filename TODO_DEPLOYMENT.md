# TODO: Complete FoodQ Deployment Architecture

## üéØ Current Status
- ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard: Properly deployed and working
- ‚úÖ Main Site: Landing website deployed with FoodQ branding
- ‚úÖ API Functions: Working correctly on main domain
- ‚úÖ Branding: All "Grabeat" references updated to "FoodQ"

## üìã Action Items Completed

### 1. ‚úÖ Deploy Landing Website (COMPLETED)
**Issue**: `https://foodq.pages.dev/` was serving Flutter web app
**Solution**: Deployed proper React landing website with FoodQ branding

**Changes Made**:
- Updated all "Grabeat" references to "FoodQ" in landing pages
- Updated HTML title: "FoodQ - Find Amazing Food Deals Near You"
- Built and deployed landing website + API functions
- Verified deployment at `https://foodq.pages.dev/`

### 2. Move Flutter App (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Issue**: Flutter app occupies main domain
**Options**:
- **Option A**: Deploy to app stores (iOS/Android)
- **Option B**: Deploy to subdomain like `app.foodq.pages.dev`

### 3. Update Documentation (LOW PRIORITY)
- [x] Create DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- [x] Create DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- [ ] Update main README.md with new architecture

## üîç Verification Steps

After deploying landing website:
```bash
# 1. Verify landing site
curl -I https://foodq.pages.dev/
# Should return HTML, not Flutter app

# 2. Verify API still works
curl https://foodq.pages.dev/api/health
# Should return JSON health status

# 3. Verify admin connection
# Admin at foodq-admin.pages.dev should connect to foodq.pages.dev/api/*
```

## üìÅ File Changes Made

1. **Added build scripts** in `package.json`:
   - `build:landing` - Builds landing website
   - `deploy` - Deploys main site (landing + API)
   - `deploy:admin` - Deploys admin dashboard

2. **Created documentation**:
   - `DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Overall architecture
   - `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step guide
   - `TODO_DEPLOYMENT.md` - This file

3. **Fixed admin client configuration**:
   - Updated to use `https://foodq.pages.dev` (stable URL)
   - Removed deployment-specific URLs
   - Verified Google OAuth login works

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run landing website deployment
2. **Plan**: Decide Flutter app deployment strategy  
3. **Monitor**: Ensure all services work after changes
