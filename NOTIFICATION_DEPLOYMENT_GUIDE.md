## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Verification

### Database Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Check recent events
SELECT 
  event_type, status, created_at, processed_at,
  (payload->>'businessName') as business,
  (payload->>'amount') as amount
FROM event_queue 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check notifications created
SELECT 
  event_type, recipient_type, title, body, 
  created_at, is_read, priority
FROM notifications 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check FCM delivery success
SELECT 
  n.title, dl.channel, dl.status, dl.attempted_at,
  dl.provider_response->>'successCount' as fcm_success
FROM notifications n
JOIN delivery_log dl ON n.id = dl.notification_id
WHERE dl.channel = 'fcm'
ORDER BY dl.attempted_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check location-based notifications
SELECT 
  title, body, 
  (location_context->>'distance_km')::float as distance,
  location_context->>'user_location_type' as location_type,
  created_at
FROM notifications 
WHERE location_context IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Real-time Monitoring

```sql
-- Event processing rate (last hour)
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('minute', created_at) as minute,
  COUNT(*) as events_created,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'processed') as events_processed,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'failed') as events_failed
FROM event_queue 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('minute', created_at)
ORDER BY minute DESC;

-- Notification delivery stats
SELECT 
  channel,
  COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'sent') as successful,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'sent')::numeric / 
    COUNT(*) * 100, 2
  ) as success_rate
FROM delivery_log 
WHERE attempted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY channel;
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Webhook Not Triggering

**Symptoms:** Events created but webhook never called

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Check if pg_net extension is available
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_net';

-- If not available, webhook will use NOTIFY instead
LISTEN event_queue_webhook;

-- Check webhook URL configuration
SELECT current_setting('app.webhook_url', true);
```

### Issue 2: FCM Notifications Not Sent

**Symptoms:** Delivery log shows failed FCM attempts

**Solutions:**
1. Check Firebase credentials in Cloudflare Worker
2. Verify FCM tokens are valid and active
3. Check Firebase project settings

```sql
-- Check FCM token status
SELECT 
  platform, is_active, failure_count, last_failure_reason
FROM push_tokens 
WHERE user_id = 'your-test-user-id';
```

### Issue 3: Location Functions Not Working

**Symptoms:** Location-based notifications not triggered

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Check PostGIS extension
SELECT PostGIS_Version();

-- Test location function
SELECT * FROM find_users_near_location(37.7749, -122.4194, 5);

-- Check user locations
SELECT 
  location_type, latitude, longitude, 
  notification_radius_km, active
FROM user_locations 
WHERE user_id = 'your-test-user-id';
```

### Issue 4: Performance Issues

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Check index usage
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE recipient_id = 'user_id' AND is_read = false;

-- Monitor query performance
SELECT 
  query, calls, total_time, mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%notifications%'
ORDER BY total_time DESC;
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization

1. **Partition Large Tables** (if needed)
```sql
-- Partition notifications by month
CREATE TABLE notifications_2024_12 PARTITION OF notifications
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-12-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

2. **Add Additional Indexes** (if needed)
```sql
-- For heavy notification filtering
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_notifications_recipient_type_created
ON notifications(recipient_id, type, created_at DESC)
WHERE is_read = false;
```

### Webhook Optimization

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Process multiple events in single webhook call
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries

2. **Caching**
   - Cache user tokens in worker
   - Cache location lookups

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Webhook Security
```typescript
// Always verify webhook secret
const webhookSecret = request.headers.get('X-Webhook-Secret');
if (webhookSecret !== env.WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
  return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
}
```

### Database Security
```sql
-- Ensure RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT 
  schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('notifications', 'user_locations', 'push_tokens');
```

### FCM Security
- Store Firebase credentials securely in Cloudflare
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Monitor for suspicious notification patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
